##Kolten's advice
You need to enable rewrite_module in apache in order to serve correct URL links (those without inserting 'index.php'), which are the links generated by the laravel framework.
In wamp, you can do this by clicking the icon, going to apache -> apache modules -> and enable rewrite_module

Also, in order for the server to have write access to neccessary files, run chmod o+w -R   on the storage directory in app

Then, you need to run the two .sql files to generate the tables and such
